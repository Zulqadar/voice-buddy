# Voice Buddy

Voice Buddy is a real-time voice chat application that allows users to connect with random partners and engage in free voice conversations. The project is divided into two main components: the `client` for the frontend built with React and TypeScript, and the `server` for the backend built with Node.js and TypeScript. The application leverages technologies such as WebRTC, Socket.IO, and Peerjs to enable seamless and secure voice communication.
